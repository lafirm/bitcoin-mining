## What Is Bitcoin Mining?
Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoin by solving puzzles. It consists of computing systems equipped with specialized chips competing to solve mathematical puzzles. The first bitcoin miner (as these systems are called) to solve the puzzle is rewarded with bitcoin. 

In simple terms, bitcoin mining is the process of finding the correct hash value of a block in a block chain, by using different nonce value.

Complexity increases when number of prefix zeros of a hash value increases.
